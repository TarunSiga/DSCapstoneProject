# DSCapstoneProject - UMKC ChatBot

The traditional university website, brimming with static pages and dense FAQs, often fails to deliver the dynamic, personalized experience desired by prospective and current students. Enter the chatbot: a virtual assistant capable of revolutionizing how universities engage and inform their student body. Imagine students effortlessly navigating through complex course availability and fee structures, receiving instant updates on ongoing research projects, and discovering vibrant extracurricular activities - all within a single, conversational interface. Chatbots bridge the gap between information overload and accessible knowledge, enhancing engagement and streamlining student life. With instant responses, 24/7 availability, and the ability to cater to diverse learning styles, chatbots offer a potent solution for universities seeking to foster a dynamic, informed, and connected student community.
